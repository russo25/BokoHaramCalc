# BokoHaramCalc
Boko Haram Casualty Calculator

This is a 2019 PhD Python project using the Data Science Lifecycle approach.  It uses the University of Maryland's Global Terror Database (GTD) and creates a temporal (day and month required) calculator to predict casualties caused by engagements with the BH terror group in North Africa.  It uses a notional scenario for Non-Governmental Organization's as well as governmental data analytic needs.

It forms a model for use beyond just BH.  You are welcome to use this code for academic or personal use.  If used for commercial purposes you must get permissions from the UMD's START program; a link may be be found in the Powerpoint presentations.
